The current robotics season presented by **FIRST** is Rebuilt. (https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc/game-and-season)

This is the updated and improved code for the 2026 season allowing for vision, advanced swerve, playback of matches through the robots view, and much more.

This year the code is being made through Kotlin with Java compatibly allowing for easier coding.

This code is used with a swerve drivetrain, vision, climber, and sparkmaxes with brushless NEO motors.
