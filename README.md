The current robotics season presented by **FIRST** is Rebuilt. (https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc/game-and-season)

This is the updated and improved code for the 2026 season allowing for vision, advanced swerve, playback of matches through AdvantageKit, and much more.

This code is used with a swerve drivetrain, vision, climber, and sparkmaxes with brushless NEO motors.
